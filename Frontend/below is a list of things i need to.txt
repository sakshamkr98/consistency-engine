2.DSA/C++ - I want my DSA and C++ skills to be on a very good level I will be having my end semester examinations from 25th April 2026 so before that i want to cover all the topics in my syllabus so I can score good in the exam but to be very honest i don't want to do this rigorously or rush this as DSA will help me in third year which is really where I want to showcase my DSA skills.

3.AI/ML - This is something I want to learn this year no hard and fast deadline i just want to amaze myself with knowledge about machine learning so a project or something cool is made by me is all i want.
